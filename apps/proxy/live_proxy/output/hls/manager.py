"""
HLS Output Manager

Reads from the shared TS Redis buffer, splits the stream into
keyframe-aligned TS segments (pure packet copy, no remux, no subprocess;
see segmenter.py), stores one segment per Redis chunk via the shared
format-parameterized output buffer, and maintains a rolling live playlist
descriptor in Redis that the playlist view renders per request.

One instance per channel per cluster - coordinated via the shared
output:{fmt}:owner lock, exactly like the fMP4 remux manager.
